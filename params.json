The project is sponsored by the German Building and Construction Ministry. Together with an engineering firm for city planning, the planning tool is currently developed at the VPT-department of the Berlin University of the Arts. At an alpha-stage, the tool will be evaluated in close collaboration with the Berlin-Neukölln district administration (Germany), when using it to analyse a newly advertised redevelopment area in Neukölln.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Mole, Fox and Crow\r\nThe development process is grouped into three modules.\r\n* *Mole*: QGIS-plugin, map analysis and parametrisation\r\n* *Fox*: Resulting building database \r\n* *Crow*: Webservice, queries and graphical results","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
